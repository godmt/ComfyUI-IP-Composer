representing a given visual concept. These descriptions will be embedded using CLIP’s text encoder, and used to compute a subspace for IP-Adapter concept projection.\n\nYour output must be strictly suitable for this purpose, avoiding any text that introduces noise in the embedding direction.\n\n### Conceptual Goal:\nYou must describe a wide variety of concrete, visual instances of a single concept.\nThese phrases will be used to define the semantic axis of this concept in embedding space.\nThe descriptions must be:\n- **Concrete**, not abstract.\n- **Focused solely on the concept**, with no background, no context, no emotions, and no narrative.\n- **Distinct and diverse**, covering meaningful variations (e.g., types, subcategories, styles, colors *only if relevant*).\n\n---\n\n### Description Format Guidelines:\n\nUse exactly one short sentence or phrase per description.  \nDescriptions must follow one of two forms, depending on the nature of the concept:\n\n#### 1. For concepts directly describing human characteristics or states:\nExamples include: **pose**, **action**, **age**, **expression**, **emotion**, etc.\n\n→ Use the form:\n**\"A person {{verb/condition}}\"**  \ne.g.:\n- A person sitting\n- A person jumping\n- A person looking angry\n- A person about ten years old\n\n#### 2. For concepts describing patterns, styles, materials, or general object features:\nExamples include: **pattern**, **material**, **color scheme**, etc.\n\n→ Use the form:\n**\"An object with {{attribute or style}}\"**  \ne.g.:\n- An object with a floral pattern\n- An object with a classic checkered design\n- An object with a metallic surface\n\n---\n\n### Additional Rules:\n- Do **NOT** include scene context, background, camera view, setting, lighting, or emotional interpretation.\n- Do **NOT** use multi-object descriptions or comparisons (e.g., avoid “a rose next to a vase” or “a person younger than…”).\n- Use indefinite articles: “a”, “an”, as appropriate.\n- Output in CSV format with a single column: `description`.\n\n---\n\n### Output Format (required):\n\ndescription\n<description_1>\n<description_2>\n...\n\n---\n\n### Input:\n\nGenerate at least 200 concept-specific descriptions strictly following the above format.\n\nConcept:\n"]},{"id":1,"type":"Griptape Create: Agent","pos":[920,-220],"size":[280,240],"flags":{},"order":3,"mode":0,"inputs":[{"localized_name":"agent","name":"agent","shape":7,"type":"AGENT","link":null},{"localized_name":"config","name":"config","shape":7,"type":"CONFIG","link":1},{"localized_name":"tools","name":"tools","shape":7,"type":"TOOL_LIST","link":null},{"localized_name":"rulesets","name":"rulesets","shape":7,"type":"RULESET","link":3},{"localized_name":"input_string","name":"input_string","shape":7,"type":"STRING","link":null},{"localized_name":"key_value_replacement","name":"key_value_replacement","shape":7,"type":"DICT","link":null},{"localized_name":"STRING","name":"STRING","shape":7,"type":"STRING","widget":{"name":"STRING"},"link":null},{"localized_name":"max_subtasks","name":"max_subtasks","shape":7,"type":"INT","widget":{"name":"max_subtasks"},"link":null}],"outputs":[{"localized_name":"OUTPUT","name":"OUTPUT","type":"STRING","links":[8]},{"localized_name":"AGENT","name":"AGENT","type":"AGENT","links":null}],"properties":{"cnr_id":"comfyui-griptape","ver":"2a70afd0f3d6118969cd40565e07376105661a21","Node name for S&R":"Griptape Create: Agent"},"widgets_values":["artistic medium",3]}],"links":[[1,2,0,1,1,"CONFIG"],[2,3,0,2,0,"PROMPT_DRIVER"],[3,4,0,1,3,"RULESET"],[8,1,0,9,0,"STRING"]],"groups":[],"config":{},"extra":{"ue_links":[],"ds":{"scale":1.2100000000000002,"offset":[-558.1341077891495,543.4873678310105]}},"version":0.4}
